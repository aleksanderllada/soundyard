# SoundYard

SoundYard is an old project of mine which I started before joining college and never had the time (or willingness) to finish it. It is a game in which you choose a playlist and it generates the entire environment based on the music that it's currently playing.

TBH I always wanted to make it become a real game, but I lack the skills for drawing and for game design.
